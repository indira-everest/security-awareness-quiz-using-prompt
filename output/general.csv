"Phishing Awareness","Generate a long, scenario-based question about a developer at Everest receiving a sophisticated phishing email that impersonates a known service, featuring Security Lead Jasmine.","SA-001","N/A - General Security Best Practice","A developer at Everest receives an email with the subject line 'URGENT: Security Alert on Your GitMax Account'. The sender appears to be 'GitMax Security', a service the team uses daily. The email warns that suspicious activity was detected from an unrecognized IP address and that their account will be locked in 15 minutes unless they verify their identity. It contains a prominent button that says 'Verify Your Credentials Now'. The developer notices the sender's email address is 'security@gitmax-logins.com' instead of the usual '@gitmax.com'. Recalling a recent security briefing from Jasmine, the Security Lead, what is the single most appropriate action for the developer to take? A) Click the button and enter their credentials quickly to avoid being locked out. B) Reply to the email asking for more details about the suspicious activity. C) Forward the suspicious email as an attachment to the Everest security team for analysis and then delete it from their inbox. D) Ignore the email and assume the system will resolve the issue on its own.","C) Forward the suspicious email as an attachment to the Everest security team for analysis and then delete it from their inbox.","This is a classic phishing attempt using urgency and impersonation. The slightly incorrect domain name is a key red flag. The correct procedure is never to click links or reply, but to report the potential threat to the internal security team (personified by Jasmine) so they can investigate and protect others at Everest.","N","Y","5","4","5","Tests multiple phishing indicators: urgency, impersonation, and subtle domain spoofing."
"Password Security","Generate a scenario-based question about creating a strong password, featuring Project Manager Ashok guiding a new team member at Everest.","SA-002","N/A - General Security Best Practice","Ashok, a Project Manager at Everest, is helping a new Intern set up their corporate accounts. He explains that creating a strong, unique password is their first line of defense. He shows the Intern four different password options and asks which one best represents the principles of a strong password. Which of the following passwords should the Intern choose? A) Everest#2024 B) MyDaughterIsNamedEmily! C) 7-Purple-Monkeys-Sip-Tea! D) P@ssw0rd123","C) 7-Purple-Monkeys-Sip-Tea!","The strongest password is a long passphrase that combines multiple unrelated words with numbers and symbols. It is significantly harder to crack using brute-force or dictionary attacks than shorter passwords, even those with substitutions (like 'P@ssw0rd123'), or those based on personal or company information (like A and B). Length is a more critical factor than complexity alone.","N","Y","5","4","5","Focuses on the modern best practice of using passphrases over simple complex passwords."
"Social Engineering & Safe Browsing","Generate a long, high-stakes 'What If' scenario involving a Sales Rep at Everest who receives an urgent, unusual request on social media from someone impersonating the CEO, Craig.","SA-003","N/A - General Security Best Practice","A top Sales Rep at Everest receives a direct message on a professional networking site. The profile picture and name perfectly match their CEO, Craig. The message states Craig is in a last-minute, confidential meeting with a massive potential client and his corporate laptop has failed. He urgently needs the Q3 sales projections to close the deal. The message provides a link to a public file-sharing site (e.g., FileDrop) and asks the rep to immediately download a 'template', fill it with the data, and re-upload it, stressing that time is critical and official channels are too slow. The rep knows Craig is traveling, but this out-of-protocol request feels highly unusual. What is the safest and most professional course of action? A) Upload the file as requested to support the CEO and help the company. B) Reply to the message asking for an email confirmation to their official Everest work address. C) Independently verify the request by calling Craig's known mobile number or contacting his executive assistant via a trusted, official channel. D) Ignore the message and assume it's not actually from Craig.","C) Independently verify the request by calling Craig's known mobile number or contacting his executive assistant via a trusted, official channel.","This is a spear-phishing attempt using authority and urgency. The safest action is to use an 'out-of-band' method—a different, trusted communication channel—to verify a suspicious, high-stakes request. Calling a known number or contacting an assistant confirms the request's legitimacy without engaging the potential attacker or clicking malicious links. Replying to the message (Option B) keeps the communication within the compromised channel.","N","Y","5","5","5","Complex scenario testing out-of-band verification in a high-pressure situation."
"Physical Security","Generate a scenario-based question about an Everest employee encountering a potential tailgating situation at a secure office entrance.","SA-004","N/A - General Security Best Practice","An HR Specialist at Everest is returning from their lunch break. As they scan their access badge to enter a secure side door, a person dressed in a plausible courier uniform and holding a large package hurries up behind them and says, 'Could you hold that door for me? My hands are full.' The specialist does not recognize the person and wasn't expecting a delivery at that entrance. What is the correct response to prevent a potential security breach? A) Let them in to be helpful, as they look like a legitimate courier. B) Let the door close behind them and politely direct the person to the main reception desk to sign in and get a visitor's pass. C) Ask them to show you their company ID before letting them in. D) Let them in, but then immediately report them to security.","B) Let the door close behind them and politely direct the person to the main reception desk to sign in and get a visitor's pass.","This prevents tailgating, a common social engineering tactic used to gain unauthorized physical access. Every individual, including couriers and visitors, must be properly vetted through official channels like the main reception. Holding the door for an unverified person, even if they seem legitimate, bypasses this crucial security control for the Everest office.","N","Y","5","4","5","Tests a common real-world physical security challenge (tailgating)."
