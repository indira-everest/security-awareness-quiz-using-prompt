"Phishing","Generate a Multiple Choice question about identifying a common red flag in a phishing email, focusing on the sender's email address.","GSA-001","General Security Best Practice","You receive an email from 'Netflix Support' with the sender address 'support@netfIix-logins.com'. The email says your account is suspended and asks you to click a link to verify your payment details. What is the most significant red flag? A) The email creates a sense of urgency. B) The sender's domain 'netfIix-logins.com' is not the official Netflix domain. C) The email asks for payment details. D) The email has a generic greeting like 'Dear Customer'.","B) The sender's domain 'netfIix-logins.com' is not the official Netflix domain.","Scammers often use look-alike domains to trick you. Always verify the sender's email address by checking the domain (the part after the '@' symbol) to ensure it matches the official website of the organization.","N","Y","5","4","5","Good practical example that tests a critical observation skill."
"Social Engineering","Generate a Scenario-Based question about a vishing (voice phishing) attack where an attacker impersonates IT support to gain credentials.","GSA-002","General Security Best Practice","An individual calls you, claiming to be from the IT help desk. They say there's an urgent security issue with your account and they need you to tell them your password immediately to fix it. What is the safest course of action? A) Provide the password, as it's an urgent security issue. B) Ask for their employee ID number to verify them. C) Hang up and call the official IT help desk number from a trusted source to verify the request. D) Ask them to send an email from their official address first.","C) Hang up and call the official IT help desk number from a trusted source to verify the request.","Legitimate IT support will never ask for your password over the phone. The safest action is to independently verify the request by contacting the department through an official, known channel, not by using contact information provided by the caller.","N","Y","5","4","5","Tests critical thinking and proper procedure in a common vishing scenario."
"Password Security","Generate an 'Odd One Out' style question that lists several characteristics of strong passwords and one weak one, asking the user to identify the weak characteristic.","GSA-003","General Security Best Practice","Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a strong password?

This allows an attacker to manipulate the query by providing malicious input (e.g., `' OR '1'='1'`), bypassing authentication. The correct approach is to use parameterized queries.","N","Y","5","4","5","This question directly tests a developer's ability to spot a common and critical vulnerability in code."

"True/False","Create a True/False question that tests the fundamental understanding of hashing's one-way nature versus reversible operations like encryption.","TF-DEV-04","Cryptography Fundamentals","True or False: Hashing algorithms like SHA-256 are designed to be reversible, allowing you to easily retrieve the original input data from the hash output.","False","Hashing is a one-way function. It is designed to be computationally infeasible to reverse the process and derive the original input from the hash output. This property makes it ideal for storing password digests and verifying data integrity, but not for encrypting data that needs to be decrypted later.","N","Y","5","3","5","A simple but crucial concept check on a foundational cryptographic principle."
"Mini-Story","Write a mini-story question about a developer building a file upload feature and overlooking a critical server-side validation step, leading to a remote code execution vulnerability.","MS-DEV-05","OWASP: Unrestricted File Upload","A developer, Alex, is building a profile picture upload feature. The feature correctly checks that the uploaded file is not too large. However, it only validates the `Content-Type` header to ensure it's an image (e.g., `image/jpeg`). An attacker bypasses this by uploading a malicious PHP script with the `Content-Type` header set to `image/jpeg`. What critical validation step did Alex miss? Options: A) Validating the file size. B) Validating the file's content and extension on the server-side, not just the client-provided header. C) Implementing rate limiting on uploads. D) Checking for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the filename.","B) Validating the file's content and extension on the server-side, not just the client-provided header.","The `Content-Type` header is client-controlled and cannot be trusted. The server must perform its own validation, such as checking file magic numbers and enforcing a strict allow-list of file extensions, to confirm the file is actually a safe image and not a malicious script.","N","Y","5","4","5","Relatable developer story that highlights the danger of trusting client-side data."
