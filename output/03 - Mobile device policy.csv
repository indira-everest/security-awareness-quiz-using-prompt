"Scenario-Based","Generate a scenario-based question about the mandatory timeline for installing critical security updates on laptops.","SC-001","ISM.03 §3.1","An urgent security bulletin is released for a critical vulnerability in your laptop's operating system, which is known to be actively exploited. According to the Mobile Device Policy, what is the maximum time you have to install the required update? A) Within two weeks. B) As soon as practical (within 48 hours). C) Within one month. D) At the next scheduled maintenance window.","B) As soon as practical (within 48 hours).","ISM.03 §3.1 states: 'Where updates contain fixes for critical or known exploited vulnerabilities, updates must be installed as soon as practical (within 48 hours)'.","Y","Y","5","4","5","Tests a specific, critical, time-sensitive rule."
"True/False","Create a True/False question testing the rule about using mobile devices that no longer receive security patches.","TF-002","ISM.03 §2.1","True or False: The policy allows you to continue using your mobile phone for Everest Engineering purposes even after the manufacturer has stopped providing security patches for it.","False","ISM.03 §2.1 explicitly states: 'Staff may not use a mobile for Everest Engineering purposes once security patches are no longer available.'","Y","Y","5","3","5","A direct and clear test of a prohibitive rule."
"Spot the Mistake","Generate a 'Spot the Mistake' style multiple-choice question on the mandatory configuration settings for mobile phones.","MC-003","ISM.03 §2.2 & §3.5","The Mobile Device Policy mandates several configurations for devices. Which of the following is a requirement for laptops/desktops, but NOT for mobile phones? A) Storage must be encrypted. B) The device must auto-lock after a period of being idle. C) A PIN or password is required on boot. D) The host firewall must be enabled.","D) The host firewall must be enabled.","While enabling the host firewall is a requirement for laptops and desktops (ISM.03 §3.5), it is not listed as a mandatory configuration for mobile phones in ISM.03 §2.2. The other options are required for both or specifically for mobiles.","Y","Y","5","4","5","This question requires careful reading and differentiation between rules for different device types."
"“What If…” Scenario","Create a 'What If...' scenario question regarding the policy on BYOD devices and the installation of company security software.","WI-004","ISM.03 §3.6","An employee wants to use their personal laptop (BYOD) for work but it is not able to install the standard endpoint protection agent.

C) An exception may be permitted, but it must be tracked and regularly reviewed. D) They can use the device only for non-sensitive work after signing a waiver.","C) An exception may be permitted, but it must be tracked and regularly reviewed.","ISM.03 §3.6 states that while staff must normally install the security configuration, 'Systems that are not able to install our endpoint protection agent or implement other security controls may be permitted by exception. Exceptions must be tracked and regularly reviewed.'","Y","Y","5","5","5","Tests the nuance of the BYOD policy, including the exception process."
"Comparison/Swipe","Design a multiple-choice question that compares the different mandatory screen lock times for mobile phones versus laptops.","CP-005","ISM.03 §2.2 & §3.5","The policy specifies different maximum inactivity times before a device must automatically lock. What are the correct maximum times for a mobile phone and a laptop, respectively? A) 5 minutes / 15 minutes B) 15 minutes / 5 minutes C) 5 minutes / 5 minutes D) 15 minutes / 15 minutes","A) 5 minutes / 15 minutes","According to ISM.03 §2.2, mobile phones must 'automatically lock when idle with a maximum idle time of 5 minutes.' For laptops, ISM.03 §3.5 requires 'Automatic screen lock after 15 minutes of inactivity.'","Y","Y","5","4","5","Excellent question for testing attention to detail and understanding that rules can differ by device type."
